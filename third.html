        <h3 class="engTitle">How I got to where I am now</h2>
        <pre class="engText">
          As a child, I struggled a lot, constant boredom, existential crises, anxiety, and I didn’t have a lot of patience. 
      Growing up I became a lot more patient, more determined to achieve certain goals, and I’ve dealt almost entirely with 
      the anxiety except for a few things here and there. 

          I grew up in a small area in Nova Scotia, it’s a place called Lawrencetown which is in Dartmouth. It wasn’t too bad 
      there and I managed to make some really good friends that I still talk to every day. I often struggled with my family 
      and other people, I wasn’t very cooperative and most of the time I just wanted to read or be left alone but I wasn’t 
      allowed to. Growing up in my family wasn’t too bad but my brother, sister, and father could be pretty annoying sometimes. 
      I felt like my mom was the only one that understood me but not all the time. When I was younger the summers were the
      worst, we were sent to day camps where we had to do boring activities while all my friends got to stay home or do other
      things. At some point I developed an interest in technology and started building little electronic kits which soon became 
      another favorite pastime. I also enjoyed playing video games as I still do now but it took days for my parents to allow me 
      to get a new game, they would always say that they are too violent and wouldn’t listen to what I had to say about it. While 
      I lived in Nova Scotia I dealt with a lot of anxiety, some of it was caused by church, and some caused by other factors. 
      One thing that helped with this was reading, I spent a ton of my free time just reading books. It helped me to disassociate 
      with what was going on around me and just enjoy the fictitious worlds that the books were describing.

          Going into Junior high didn’t mean much in terms of the school because elementary and junior high were at the same
      school, but it meant that I had a bit more freedom in what courses I took and that’s when I got closer to my friends that 
      I made there. I finally started trying at school and I brought my grades up, and even managed a 100 in math one year. In 
      grade 9 I did a bunch of research and with the help of a couple friends, I built my first computer. This was probably the 
      most important thing that has happened to me because I still use the same computer and it helped me connect with my friends 
      daily, play games with them, design things, create projects, and it makes doing homework a little easier and slightly more 
      bearable. To this day I’ve made many upgrades to my computer and it’s where I spend most of my time when I’m home and not sleeping.

          That computer represented a huge change in my life, it finally meant I had my own powerful computer that could run almost any 
      program I wanted to use. In preparation for building it, I bought grand theft auto 5 without the permission of my parents. My mom 
      found out in grade 10 after we moved here and she was pretty upset about it.

          Moving to P.E.I had the biggest impact on my personal growth, I met new people, I got a job, a drivers license, and with that, 
      a ton of freedom. It finally ended any ties I had with religion, and my parents couldn’t keep restricting my access to technology 
      which finally gave me the last bit of freedom which was taken away from me when I was younger. Working at the Stratford Esso gave 
      me a lot of patience because I constantly have to deal with customers who can get upset from the smallest things, so that really 
      taught me how to deal with people and how much patience I need to have. 

          Since having a job, I finally had enough money to do the things I’ve been wanting to do. I upgraded my computer, I bought better 
      gear for it, I can pay for insurance and gas for my car, and I can get parts for cool computer projects. I also spent money on a few 
      components which allow me to mine cryptocurrency which lets me make a little bit more money while doing nothing in return. Working 
      at the Esso also helped a bunch with my social skills, its now much easier for me to talk with people than before.

          In conclusion, moving to PEI, getting a job, and building my computer have had the most profound impacts on who I am today 
      and how I’ve changed since I was younger. When I moved to PEI it opened a ton of opportunities for me, I met some awesome people 
      and my anxiety almost disappeared. Building my computer has allowed me to do the things I find really fun in life. Getting a job 
      allowed me to work on my social skills and earn an income so that I can afford university and fun things like my 3d printer and 
      parts for my computer.
