          Dear Cameron, 

              I’m writing to you from the future, things may seem a little hopeless but just hold out until junior high and 
          then make sure that you move to PEI for high school, it’s so much better here. Have some patience with Dad because 
          he’ll always be stubborn about the technology stuff and probably even annoying sometimes but he’s awesome with the 
          car stuff so just take it slow with him. Some more important advice would be to try to improve on your handwriting, 
          it still looks bad. Try and be a little more social (actually a lot more) and don’t be afraid to talk to people, 
          they aren’t that scary. By the time you make it to highschool make sure you go into pre-IB because the people there 
          are awesome, however I wouldn’t recommend staying in it after grade 10. Don’t get too attached to certain people 
          because they either move out of the province or they are just a bit too suspicious(). By the time you’re looking for 
          a car, there's this really cool black mazda 3 that’s really fun to drive, just don’t be too rough with it and watch 
          for the garbage cans at the end of our driveway. Right now I don’t have enough volunteer time and community service 
          for many scholarships so try and do that if possible. If you stay strong, determined, and patient, you will be able to 
          make it all the way until and through highschool as of my knowledge so far. Try and get things done on time because I 
          seem to have a tendency of waiting until the very last minute to finish things. Try not to overwork yourself either 
          because it doesn’t take too long to get burnt out and then you would be physically sick which would put you even further 
          behind. Also don’t preorder anything, I made that mistake a couple of times and I still regret it because the games sucked. 
          As for the “internet issues”, you can set up a hotspot on an old PC or something like a Pi zero W with an ethernet cable to 
          the modem and Ashton or Sam might be able to help with that. As soon as you get your own router and ethernet switch you 
          should be fine, total control over the network feels awesome once you achieve it. For now that’s most of the wisdom I have 
          for you, goodluck, have fun, and don’t be too toxic on video games

          Dear Mom,

              Thank you for being so supportive, without you I know for sure I wouldn’t be nearly as happy or healthy as I am now. You’ve 
          always understood me and helped me through tough times and always helped me reason with dad.
