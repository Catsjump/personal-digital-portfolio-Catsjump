            I just got a monitor for my Raspberry Pi! I’m not really sure what I can do with it but I can program things and 
            try to make small games with it. I can’t wait to show Uncle Andy the cool things that I'm gonna make with it.

          I just finished Junior high today, I said goodbye to a lot of my friends and Ella gave me a couple boxes of oreos.
          It made me really sad to say goodbye to her because I probably won’t see her for a while since I’m moving to PEI  
          and I think she’s moving back to B.C sometime. Before I leave Nova Scotia I’ll make sure to hang out with Lawrence 
          and Ryan again.

          March break finishes tonight, but I had the best week with my friends, I had Sam, Lawrence, and Ryan over at my house 
          and we spent most of our time up until 4am in the morning playing siege, GTA and overwatch. Disaster struck with the 
          Covid-19 outbreak at the start of the week so we couldn’t really do much outside of the house. We might be going back 
          to school and hopefully Lawrence and Ryan can make it back okay.

          The past couple weeks have been an absolute mess, but the weirdness could have just ended today?
          The week leading up to this march break wasn’t the best. On friday I hung out with Brynn. 
          I asked some questions because I was curious and I regret it a little bit now. I also just learned 
          a couple of things about them that I really didn’t want to know. 

              The first thing that I found out was that she doesn’t enjoy any kind of dinner dates, that’s fine 
          to be honest but the list just goes on. Later that night I saw her texting another guy her address 
          for some reason so I asked and she was apparently getting this guy from Ontario to ship her a macbook, 
          Which is a little bit weird in my opinion. But. It gets even worse. The next couple of things weren’t 
          as bad, but I found out that she doesn’t like any kind of physical contact which is a bit disappointing, 
          she was also messaging another guy way more than she was messaging me, and she mentioned that she found 
          another different ethnicity really attractive, there’s nothing wrong with that it’s just that she mentioned 
          it to me… I felt pretty terrible on my way back home that night. The next day I didn’t receive a single 
          message. Monday at school seemed more or less like a normal day so I was going to talk to her about these 
          things the next day but she wasn’t there. On wednesday I got covid so I was out of school and couldn’t 
          really do anything during march break either. I was getting kinda sad so I decided to buy a game for the 
          break and spent most of my time playing that. On Tuesday of the break I got a message from her asking me 
          to turn my minecraft server on, but nobody joined it and a couple days later she started up her own server. 
          At that point I just thought that it was kinda over. The next morning I saw that she posted on her story 
          that she received $6000 worth of apple products from that guy in ontario. After I saw that I just decided to 
          remove her on almost all of my social media platforms. I’m still not sure about what will happen in school on 
          monday but at this point I don’t really feel like talking to her.

          Brynn and I tried to get back together again but earlier this week I talked to her about things and she just said 
          that I worry too much about these things and didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing on her part or anything. Later that 
          day I sent a message asking what we are anymore and she said probably just friends at this point. I feel better 
          about things now but I feel like my confidence and motivation are now not as strong as they were. It's probably 
          better this way because now I can save a bit more money and have more time for school and work.
