          I chose this for my creative piece because it symbolizes a few things in my childhood and also 
          after growing as a person. It symbolizes the time I spent with my family, and one of the main 
          reasons why we moved here to PEI which had the biggest effect on me as a person. The boat I 
          printed represents our boat that we used to sail here on every summer which ultimately led 
          to us moving here. It also represents the very first thing I printed with my 3d printer, 
          which is one of my biggest creative outlets. It helps me put my ideas in the real world, which 
          has been one of my dreams since I was little. I can finally build the things I couldnâ€™t before 
          when I was younger.
