        <h3 class="engTitle">How to exist (and not feel sad)</h3>
        <pre class="engText">
          
          Step 1)
          Get some sleep, it kinda sucks sometimes because there's so many other things to do but in order to be productive and feel 
          energized sleep is the answer. 8-10 hours is usually just right.

          Step 2)
          Talk to friends, or just people in general. Without that you’ll probably feel a little sad or lonely but make sure you don’t 
          stay up until 4:00am in the morning talking because sleep is still very important.

          Step 3)
          Get homework and chores done early, playing games and working on projects are much more enjoyable when you don’t have to 
          deal with the stress of piles of work that needs to get done.

          Step 4)
          Play games, whether it’s online with other people, by yourself, or even together in person with friends. As long as it’s 
          enjoyable and not just another chore.

          Step 5)
          Have some quiet / alone time. As much as we need to socialize with each other, having alone time can be really important for 
          relieving stress. Just not for too long.
