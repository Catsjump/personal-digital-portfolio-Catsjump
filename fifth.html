              There was a boy who didn't enjoy very much, he liked school because it gave him something to do and he enjoyed 
          reading at home. Sports and extracurricular activities weren't his favourite. The summers were pretty bland, 
          he was forced to attend a daycamp in the blistering heat. The winters were okay with warm food to eat and fun 
          activities in the snow. he enjoyed spending time with his friends who had parents much less strict than his own 
          so he felt a little bit more free.
